Assessing the Burdens of Leadership: The Effects of Formal Leadership Roles on Individual Performance
================

## Summary of project

Our project considers how being a leader affects an individual's performance. Specifically, we examined a 2004 article written by David V. Day, Hock-Peng Sin, and Tina T. Chen that uses National Hockey League (NHL) data from 201 players throughout their careers to investigate the effect of captainship on a player's performance. The authors use adjusted points as the response variable, a metric that takes into account games played by the player in a season, as well as seasons with relatively high or low total scoring compared to the average NHL season. The researchers first fit a multilevel model, where the first level predicts the individual number of adjusted points for all 201 players across their careers using two predictor variables: the number of seasons the player was a captain before the current season and an indicator of whether the player was a captain in that season. The second-level model aggregates the first level estimates and creates a composite model to predict adjusted points using individual predictor variables such as height, position, seasons played before first becoming a captain, age when they first became a captain, and the total number of times a player was a captain throughout his career. The goal of our project is to analyze the authors' study in two ways: how multilevel models are incorporated into their research and how effectively do the authors communicate their findings.
